  This project focuses on developing mHealth solutions that monitor blood pressure and mental health during the postpartum period. By leveraging wearable technology and AI-driven models, the aim is to provide early detection of health issues and prevent delays in healthcare intervention. These efforts target improved outcomes for new mothers, particularly in low-resource settings.
