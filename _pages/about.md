I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Biomedical Informatics, School of Medicine, Emory University. My research focuses on developing AI models and engineering techniques to quantify fetal-maternal physiology, with the goal of advancing health monitoring during pregnancy and postpartum period, particularly in underrepresented communities. As an affiliate research scientist in the center for indigenous health studies at Wuqu' Kawoq | Maya Health Alliance, I leverage edge computing and machine learning models to detect and predict cardiovascular complications in pregnancy. In addition, my work explores health disparities in maternal health by identifying individual, healthcare, and environmental factors that contribute to pregnancy-related complications. My research goal is to develop comprehensive and holistic healthcare strategies that effectively address the challenges faced by diverse communities, aiming for a more equitable maternal healthcare.
